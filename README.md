UserScripts for Canvas LMS

Canvas Remove Teacher Tool is a script that will allow an admin to remove teachers (teacher base roles) from courses in bulk. The table is sortable by name or last activity date. The "Add More" button will load the next 100 teachers. It is useful for managing manually created course enrollments for Blueprints.

The script uses the Canvas API to list all of the teachers in a course. It then uses a user interface to allow the Admin to select which teachers they want to remove. Once the teachers have been selected, the script sends a request to Canvas to remove the selected teachers.
