UserScripts for Canvas LMS

Canvas Remove Teacher Tool is a script that will allow an admin to remove teachers (teacher base roles) from courses in bulk. The table is sortable by name or last activity date. The "Add More" button will load the next 100 teachers. It is useful for managing manually created course enrollments for Blueprints. 

Here is a summary of the script's functionality:
<ul>
<li>Lists all of the teachers in a course.</li>
<li>Allows the user to select which teachers they want to remove.</li>
</ul>
